Ruby class tests
================

Tests of the standard Ruby 2.0.0 classes using Rspec written whilst learning
to code at Makers Academy.

Evgeny Shadchev demonstrated how to test methods in the Hash class.

I paired with Margo Urey (margOnline) to write several tests for the methods
provided in the Array class.
